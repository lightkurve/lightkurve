2.0.0 (unreleased)
==================


Major changes
-------------

- Removed support for Python 2. [#733]

- ``LightCurve`` is now a sub-class of ``astropy.time.TimeSeries`` to enable it
  to have arbitrary columns and to enable closer integration with AstroPy. [#744]


Other changes
-------------

lightkurve.lightcurve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added a ``column`` parameter to ``LightCurve``'s ``plot()``, ``scatter()``,
  and ``errorbar()`` methods to enable any column to be plotted. [#765]

- Added the ``LightCurve.create_transit_mask(period, transit_time, duration)``
  method to conveniently mask planet or eclipsing binary transits. [#808]

- Added a ``column`` parameter to ``LightCurve.remove_nans()`` to enable
  cadences to be removed which contain NaN values in a specific column. [#828]

lightkurve.targetpixelfile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added the ability to perform math with ``TargetPixelFile`` objects, e.g.,
  ``tpf = tpf - 100`` will subtract 100 from the ``tpf.flux`` values. [#665]

- Added the ``TargetPixelFile.plot_pixels()`` method to plot light curves
  and periodograms for each individual pixel in a TPF. [#771]

- Added the ``estimate_background`` method to ``TargetPixelFile`` which returns
  a 1D estimate of the residual background present in e.g. TESSCut data. [#746]

- Added a ``column`` parameter to ``TargetPixelFile.plot()`` to enable any
  column in a pixel file to be plotted (e.g. ``column="BKG_FLUX"``). [#738]

- Modified ``to_lightcurve()`` to default to using ``aperture_mask='threshold'``
  if the ``'pipeline'`` mask is missing or empty, e.g. for TESSCut files. [#833]

- Modified ``plot()`` to use a more clear hatched style when visualizing the
  aperture mask on top of pixel data. [#814]

- Modified ``_parse_aperture_mask()`` to ensure that masks composed of integer
  or floats are always converted to booleans. [#694]

- Fixed a bug in ``TargetPixelFile.__getitem__()`` which caused a substantial
  memory leak on indexing or slicing a tpf. [#829]

lightkurve.search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added support for reading K2SFF and EVEREST community light curves via the
  ``LightCurve.read()`` and ``search_lightcurve()`` functions. [#739]

- Modified the search functions such that exact mission target identifiers,
  such as 'KIC 5112705' or 'TIC 261136679', only return products known under
  those names, unless a search radius is specified. [#796]

lightkurve.correctors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added the ``CotrendingBasisVectors`` class to provide a convenient interface
  to work with TESS and Kepler basis vector data products. [#826]

- Added ``SparseDesignMatrix`` and modified ``RegressionCorrector`` to enable
  systematics removal methods to benefit from ``scipy.sparse`` speed-ups. [#732]

- Modified ``PLDCorrector`` to make use of the new ``RegressionCorrector``
  and ``DesignMatrix`` classes. [#746]

- Fixed a bug in ``SFFCorrector`` which caused correction to fail if a light
  curve's ``centroid_col`` or ``centroid_row`` columns contained NaNs. [#827]

lightkurve.seismology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Modified the ``estimate_radius``, ``estimate_mass``, and ``estimate_logg``
  methods to default to the ``teff`` value in the meta data. [#766]

- Added an error message to ``estimate_numax()`` or ``estimate_deltanu()`` if
  the underlying periodogram does not have uniformly-spaced frequencies. [#780]

lightkurve.periodogram
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Modified ``create_transit_mask`` method to return ``True`` during transits and
  ``False`` elsewhere for consistent mask syntax. [#808]

  motion stars to be shown at incorrect locations. [#730]



1.9.1 (2020-03-25)
==================

- Increased the speed of ``search_lightcurvefile()`` and
  ``search_targetpixelfile()`` by a factor ~10x. [#715]

- Fixed an issue which caused ``interact()`` and ``interact_bls()`` to be

1.6.0 (2019-12-16)
==================

- Fixed a bug in ``tpf.to_lightcurve()`` which caused ``flux`` and ``flux_err``
  to be ``0`` instead of ``NaN`` for cadences with all-NaN pixels. [#651]

- Added a new TESS data anomaly flag (bit 13 / value 4096) which was introduced
  in Sector 14 to mark cadences affected by strong scattered light.  Compared
  to the original stray light flag (bit 12), this flag is set automatically by
  the pipeline based on background level thresholds. [#652]

- Changed the requirements to make ``fbpca`` a required dependency, because
  it allows ``DesignMatrix.pca()`` to be faster and more robust. [#653]



1.5.2 (2019-12-05)
==================

  interoperability with the `Stingray <https://stingraysoftware.github.io/>`_
  spectral timing package. [#567]

- Added an `ax` (axes) keyword to ``Seismology.plot_echelle()`` to enable
  Echelle diagrams to be plotted into an existing Matplotlib figure. [#635]



1.4.1 (2019-11-18)
==================

- Fixed a bug which caused ``search_targetpixelfile`` and
  ``search_lightcurvefile`` to raise an ``IndexError`` if the sector keyword
  was passed and the target was observed by both TESS & Kepler. [#631]



1.4.0 (2019-11-12)

  which deprecated the ``polyorder`` keyword in favor of ``degree``.
  [#613, #616, #617, #626]

- Changed the `tutorials index page <https://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials>`_
  in the online docs to make the tutorials easier to navigate.

- Added a tutorial which demonstrates the use of Lightkurve's seismology module
  to measure the mass, radius, and surface gravity of a solar-like star. [#624]

- Changed ``SearchResult.download()`` to raise a more explicit ``HTTPError``
  exception when MAST's TESSCut service is overloaded and times out. [#627]



1.3.0 (2019-10-21)
==================

- Added a ``method="quadratic"`` option to ``tpf.estimate_centroids()`` which
  enables centroids to be estimated by fitting a bivariate polynomial to the
  3x3 pixel core of the PSF. The method can also be called as a standalone
  function via ``lightkurve.utils.centroid_quadratic()``. [#544, #610]

- Fixed a bug in ``Seismology.plot_echelle()`` which caused the Echelle diagram
  of a power spectrum to be rendered incorrectly. [#602]

  ie. plots now display a light curve in its intrinsic units by default. [#591]

- Added an optional ``unit`` argument to ``LightCurve.normalize()`` to make it
  convenient to obtain a relative light curve in percent (``unit='percent'``),
  parts per thousand (``unit='ppt'``) or parts per million (``unit='ppm'``). [#591]

- Changed ``LombScarglePeriodogram.from_lightcurve()`` to not normalize the
  input light curve by default. [#591]

==================

This is the first stable release of Lightkurve.  It was prepared with the help
of 45 contributors!

This release contains major changes to the ``LombScarglePeriodogram`` class:

- Changed the default behavior of ``LombScarglePeriodogram.from_lightcurve()``
  to use ``normalization='amplitude'`` and ``oversample_factor=5`` (the previous
  defaults were ``normalization='psd'`` and ``oversample_factor=1``).
  The docstring has been expanded to help users understand these options. [#491]

- Added a ``LightkurveWarning`` to alert users of the changes to the default
  behavior. [#493]

- Deprecated the ``min_frequency``/``max_frequency`` arguments in favor of
  ``minimum_frequency``/``maximum_frequency`` to be consistent with the other
  Periodogram classes. [#478]

- Likewise, deprecated the ``min_period``/``max_period`` arguments in favor of
  ``minimum_period``/``maximum_period`` to be consistent with the other
  Periodogram classes. [#478]

Other changes are:

- Improved ``PLDCorrector`` to be more robust against the presence of NaNs.
  [#479, #488]

1.0b23 (2018-11-30)
===================

- ``TargetPixelFile.create_threshold_mask()`` now only returns one contiguous
  mask, which is configurable using the new ``reference_pixel`` argument [#345].

  ``KeplerLightCurveFile`` have been deprecated in favor of the new
  ``search_targetpixelfile()`` and ``search_lightcurvefile()`` functions.
  These allow users to inspect the results of their queries and offer more
  powerful features, e.g. cone-searches.  If you are currently using
  ``tpf = KeplerTargetPixelFile.from_archive("objectname")``, please start
  using ``tpf = search_targetpixelfile("objectname").download()`` instead.
