Citing dependencies
-------------------

Lightkurve was built on top of a number of powerful libraries,
including `NumPy <https://www.numpy.org/>`_, `SciPy <https://scipy.org>`_, and `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_.
We strongly encourage you to cite these packages as well.
In particular, we request that all astronomy publications cite the relevant
astronomy packages, which include:

* `astropy <https://astropy.org>`_ (see `astropy citation instructions <https://www.astropy.org/acknowledging.html>`_) enabled all features.
* `astroquery <https://astroquery.readthedocs.io>`_ (see `astroquery citation instructions <https://github.com/astropy/astroquery#citing-astroquery>`_) enabled all `~lightkurve.search` functions.
* `tesscut <https://mast.stsci.edu/tesscut/>`_ (see `tesscut citation instructions <https://ascl.net/code/v/2239>`_) enabled `~lightkurve.search.search_tesscut`.

If your package is missing from the list above, please `open a pull request <https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve>`_ to add it.
