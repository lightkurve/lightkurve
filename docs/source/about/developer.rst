Developer documentation
=======================

Lightkurve is actively developed on its `GitHub repository <https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve>`_.
This page provides guidelines for package developers and maintainers.


Coding and documentation standards
----------------------------------

Lightkurve adopts AstroPy's coding guidelines and standards,
as documented in `AstroPy's Development Documentation <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/index.html#developer-documentation>`_.


Building documentation
----------------------

.. note::

    Building the documentation is not necessary unless you are
    writing new documentation or do not have internet access, because the
    latest version of the documentation is available online at
    `docs.lightkurve.org <https://docs.lightkurve.org/>`_ .

Building the *lightkurve* documentation requires a few extra packages:

- sphinx
- sphinx-automodapi
- nbsphinx
- ghp-import
- graphviz
- `numpydoc <https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc>`_

These packages can be installed using `conda` or `pip`.

To build the documentation in HTML format, execute::

    $ cd docs
    $ make clean
    $ make html

This will save the documentation website in the ``../../lightkurve-docs`` directory
on your system.  The notebook-based tutorials will not be recompiled by default
because they take some time to build.  To recompile the notebooks, type::

    make notebooks

Finally, if you have write permission to *lightkurve*'s GitHub repository,
you can upload the documentation to the web server using::

    make upload


Release procedure
-----------------

The procedure to release a new version of Lightkurve requires a number
of manual steps:

1. Add any new contributors to `AUTHORS.rst`.

2. Remove the suffix `.dev` from the version number in `lightkurve/version.py` and commit to master. Note that Lightkurve follows a `semantic versioning scheme <https://semver.org>`_.

3. Verify that all unit tests pass:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pytest --remote-data

4. Verify that the docs and all tutorial notebooks can be compiled without failure (see *Building documentation* above), and upload them to the webserver.

5. Edit the CHANGES.rst file by changing the date for the version you are about to release from “unreleased” to today’s date. Also be sure to make sure the change log is complete and accurate. Then add and commit those changes with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git add CHANGES.rst
    $ git commit -m "Finalizing changelog for v<version>"

6. Make a new release branch in GitHub using the `Draft a new release button` at https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve/releases.

7. Create and upload the new package to PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py release

8. Increment the version number on the `lightkurve conda feedstock <https://github.com/conda-forge/lightkurve-feedstock>`_.  Navigate to the :code:`meta.yaml` file in the :code:`recipe` directory and change two lines:

.. code-block:: yaml

  {% set version = "1.0b20" %}
  {% set sha256 = "b65f556362b64d9fcc8aa4b0e89991c2b8f7fc059dfa22269b0877a8b758b255" %}

Replace the `version` and `sha256` values with the most recent release info in `the lightkurve PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/lightkurve/>`_.  Submit your update as a Pull Request, which offers a checklist to guide programmatic spot-checking of your code.

9. Edit `lightkurve/version.py` to contain the next version number with suffix `.dev`.
