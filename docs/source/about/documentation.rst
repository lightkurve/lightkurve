Building the documentation
==========================

Coding and documentation standards
----------------------------------

Lightkurve adopts AstroPy's coding guidelines and standards,
as documented in `AstroPy's Development Documentation <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/index.html#developer-documentation>`_.


Building documentation
----------------------

.. note::

    Building the documentation is not necessary unless you are
    writing new documentation or do not have internet access, because the
    latest version of the documentation is available online at
    `docs.lightkurve.org <https://docs.lightkurve.org/>`_ .

Building the *lightkurve* documentation requires a few extra packages:

- sphinx
- sphinx-automodapi
- nbsphinx
- ghp-import
- graphviz
- `numpydoc <https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc>`_

These packages can be installed using `conda` or `pip`.

To build the documentation in HTML format, execute::

    $ cd docs
    $ make clean
    $ make html

This will save the documentation website in the ``../../lightkurve-docs`` directory
on your system.  The notebook-based tutorials will not be recompiled by default
because they take some time to build.  To recompile the notebooks, type::

    make notebooks

Finally, if you have write permission to *lightkurve*'s GitHub repository,
you can upload the documentation to the web server using::

    make upload
