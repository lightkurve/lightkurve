Light curves
------------

The :class:`lightkurve.lightcurve` module provides classes to represent time-series photometry. The classes provide easy access to a range of common operations, e.g. folding, binning, and plotting.
There are specific sub-classes for light curves observed by the Kepler and TESS missions, which provides easy access to mission-specific metadata.
The generic :class:`LightCurve <lightkurve.lightcurve.LightCurve>` class can be used for any data set.

.. automodsumm:: lightkurve.lightcurve


Accessing data
--------------

The :class:`lightkurve.search` module provides functions which make it easy to search and load data products from the Kepler and TESS missions, or search for them by name or coordinates at the `public data archive at MAST <https://archive.stsci.edu/>`_.

.. automodsumm:: lightkurve.search


Data file classes
-----------------

Lightkurve provides classes to interact with the files that are generated by NASA's Kepler and TESS data processing pipelines and made available at the `data archive <https://archive.stsci.edu/>`_.
The :class:`lightkurve.lightcurvefile` module provides classes which represent FITS files that store one or more light curves.
These classes provide methods to access the metadata or read in a stored light curve into a :class:`LightCurve <lightkurve.lightcurve.LightCurve>` object.

.. automodsumm:: lightkurve.lightcurvefile


The :class:`lightkurve.targetpixelfile` module provides classes which represent FITS files that store the original pixel data (images) obtained by the Kepler or TESS telescopes.
These classes provide methods to extract custom light curves from the pixel data.

.. automodsumm:: lightkurve.targetpixelfile


Correcting systematics
----------------------

Telescope data is always affected by systematic noise contributed by the instrument. The :class:`lightkurve.correctors` module provides classes which offer different strategies to remove such noise:

.. automodsumm:: lightkurve.correctors


Finding periodic signals
------------------------

The :class:`lightkurve.periodogram` module provides classes to help find periodic signals in light curves.

.. automodsumm:: lightkurve.periodogram


Utilities
---------

The :class:`lightkurve.utils` module provides a range of common helper functions and classes.

.. automodsumm:: lightkurve.utils
