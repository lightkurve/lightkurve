Welcome to lightkurve!
======================

The **lightkurve** package offers a user-friendly way
to inspect and analyze astronomical flux time series data,
in particular the pixels and lightcurves obtained by
**NASA's Kepler, K2, and TESS missions**.
It aims to provide the building blocks necessary to build
custom lightcurves and pipelines.

This is a community project supported by the
`Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office <https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov>`_.
The development `takes place on GitHub <https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve>`_ and everyone is :ref:`invited to contribute<contributing>`.
