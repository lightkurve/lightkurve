.. currentmodule:: lightkurve

Telescope data is always affected by noise contributed by the instrument.
The ``lightkurve.correctors`` sub-package provides classes which offer
different strategies to remove such noise.
At the core of the package lies the generic `.RegressionCorrector` class.
It uses linear regression to correlate a light curve against a `.DesignMatrix`
of column vectors which are known to correlate with additive noise components.

The `PLDCorrector` and `SFFCorrector` classes extend `RegressionCorrector`
by providing the user with pre-configured `DesignMatrix` objects which are
known to be effective at removing different types of noise.

A DesignMatrix has the following attributes:

  DesignMatrix.X
  DesignMatrix.rank
  DesignMatrix.shape
  DesignMatrix.values

A DesignMatrix supports the following operations:

.. autosummary::

  DesignMatrix.append_constant
  DesignMatrix.collect
  DesignMatrix.copy
  DesignMatrix.pca
  DesignMatrix.plot
  DesignMatrix.plot_priors
