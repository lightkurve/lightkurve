    read

In general, users only need to call the `read` function, also available as
``lightkurve.read``.  This function will auto-detect the type of data product
being opened and pass it on to a product-specific reader function.

Below we list the product-specific reader functions.  These functions
are not intended to be called directly because it is much easier to
simply call the `read` function.  We include the functions here because
their documentation lists the optional parameters that can be passed to
the generic `read()` function, and because they document information
pertaining to specific products.
