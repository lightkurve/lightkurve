    "One of the most common questions we get at the Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office is \"I see a noise blip in my K2 lightcurve.  Is it real or instrumental?\"  Answering the question usually entails ticking through our (long, incomplete) mental list of conceivable, sometimes exotic instrumental artifacts.  Space-craft induced periodic motion.  Rolling band.  Cosmic Rays.  Collateral cosmic rays.  Smear.  Sudden pixel sensitivity dropouts.  Fine-guidance-sensor cross talk.  Regular cross talk.
