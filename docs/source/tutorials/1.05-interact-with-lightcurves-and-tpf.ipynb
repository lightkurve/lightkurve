    "One of the most common questions we get at the Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office is \"I see a noise blip in my K2 lightcurve.  Is it real or instrumental?\"  Answering the question usually entails ticking through our (long, incomplete) mental list of conceivable, sometimes exotic instrumental artifacts.  Space-craft induced periodic motion.  Rolling band.  Cosmic Rays.  Collateral cosmic rays.  Smear.  Sudden pixel sensitivity dropouts.  Fine-guidance-sensor cross talk.  Regular cross talk.

    "We have recently extended `.interact()` to offer instantaneous interactive selection of the pixel mask.  You can now click on individual pixels and the aperture photometry updates.  The mask can be defined with either individual clicking of pixels, or clicking and dragging a box over a rectangular set of pixels.  *De*selection of individual pixels also works-- simply re-click a pixel that you wish to take away from your mask.\n",
