    "In order to search for planets around other stars, the *Kepler* space telescope performed near-continuous monitoring of a single field of view, from an Earth-trailing orbit. However, this posed a challenge. If the space telescope is trailing Earth and maintaining steady pointing, its solar panels would slowly receive less and less sunlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make sure the solar panels remained oriented towards the Sun, *Kepler* performed quarterly rolls, one every 93 days. The infographic below helps visualize this, and shows the points in the orbit where the rolls took place.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each roll, *Kepler* retained its fine-pointing at the same field of view. Because the camera rotated by 90 degrees, all of the target stars fell on different parts of the charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. This had an effect on the amount of flux recorded for the same star, because different CCD pixels have different sensitivities. The way in which the flux from the same stars was distributed on the CCD (called the point spread function or PSF) also changed after each roll, due to focus changes and other instrumental effects. As a result, the aperture mask set for a star had to be recomputed after each roll, and may capture slightly different amounts of flux. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data obtained between rolls is referred to as a quarter. While there are changes to the flux *systematics*, not much else changes quarter to quarter, and the majority of the target list remains identical. This means that, after removing systematic trends (such as was done for the presearch data conditioning simple aperture photometry (PDCSAP) flux), multiple quarters together can form one continuous observation.\n",
