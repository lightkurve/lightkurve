    "\n",
    "The _Kepler_ space telescope observed the same patch of sky for four continuous years, between 2009 and 2013. Over the course of 18 observing quarters, it collected light curves and pixel data for 150,000 stars in 30-minute Long Cadence mode, and 512 stars per quarter in one-minute Short Cadence mode. Following the failure of two of the telescope's four reaction wheels, the telescope continued as the _K2_ mission, which observed along the ecliptic plane for 20 campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll explore some quality issues that arose during both the _Kepler_ and _K2_ missions, and learn how to identify and mitigate them. It's important to note that many of these issues only appear in the calibrated pixels or simple aperture photometry (SAP) data, and more still are removed by a quality masking process which we'll discuss in the next section. If you're working with presearch data conditioning SAP (PDCSAP) light curves, you won't run into many of these issues."

    "\n",
    "Before we look at some practical examples in time series data, let's familiarize ourselves with how data gaps and single-cadence quality events are identified in _Kepler_ data files. Every _Kepler_ FITS file has a [QUALITY](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.KeplerTargetPixelFile.quality.html?highlight=quality#lightkurve.KeplerTargetPixelFile.quality) column, which contains a quality flag for each individual data cadence. These flags comprise of one or more binary bits, which are expressed as an integer. A handy reference document for _Kepler_'s quality flags is Table 2-3 in the [MAST Kepler Archive Manual](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/k2/_documents/MAST_Kepler_Archive_Manual_2020.pdf).\n",

    "### 2.1 Monthly data downlink\n",
    "\n",
    "During the _Kepler_ mission, the telescope changed its orientation once a month to point at Earth and downlink the last month of data. This caused a gap in the time series data, as the telescope could not collect while it was downlinking. When the telescope returned to regular pointing, its motion induced what is known as a \"thermal transient.\" This means that the telescope components and detector electronics underwent a temperature change, and the electron count reading was temporarily increased. A change in temperature can slightly change the telescope focus. This manifests in the simple aperture photometry (SAP) data as a downward slope caused by \"reheating,\" while the flux returns to its previous level. The thermal transient is corrected in PDCSAP data; there is no quality flag for data affected by a thermal transient.

    "*Kepler*'s orientation, or attitude, was adjusted every few days during Quarters 0, 1, and 2 of the nominal mission. Specifically, attitude tweaks ensured that no star would ever move more than 1/100th of a pixel from its expected location in each cadence ([_Kepler_ Data Characteristics Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/Data_Characteristics.pdf), Section 4.4). From Quarter 3 onwards, changes to the telescope's Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) system (see the [_Kepler_ Instrument Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/KSCI-19033-002-instrument-hb.pdf), particularly sections 2.1 and 2.5.1) led to reduced drift, which meant that attitude tweaks were no longer necessary.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Kepler*'s attitude was controlled initially by four reaction wheels. Bits 5 and 6 are allocated to two data quality events caused by the reaction wheels: zero crossings and momentum desaturation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero crossings (bit 5/integer 16) occur when the reaction wheels have zero angular velocity ([_Kepler_ Data Characteristics Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/Data_Characteristics.pdf), Section 5.4). This caused the telescope's point to degrade for a few minutes at a time. Because of this short timescale, reaction wheel zero crossings are mostly an issue in Short Cadence data, where they manifest as negative spikes in the flux data. Zero crossing events became less prominent after the failure of one of *Kepler*'s reaction wheels in Quarter 14, due to an increase in speed of the remaining reaction wheels. There were no reaction wheel zero crossings in the *K2* mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum desaturation (bit 6/integer 32) was a consequence of a build up of torque on the reaction wheels ([_Kepler_ Data Characteristics Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/Data_Characteristics.pdf), Section 5.3). Desaturation events occurred every 146 Long Cadences during the _Kepler_ mission, leading to coarse pointing mode (as above) and NaN values in the light curves for one Long Cadence or several Short Cadences at a time.\n",

    "\n",
    "For various reasons, some cadences were manually excluded during the data processing stage. In general, these cadences were those on either side of gaps and discontinuities, but sometimes manual exclusions were used to cover specific events that didn't fall under any other category. For example, during Quarter 12, a series of three coronal mass ejections from the Sun led to multiple cadences being manually excluded ([_Kepler_ Data Release 25 Notes](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/release_notes/release_notes25/KSCI-19065-002DRN25.pdf), Section 12.2). Further solar flares and coronal mass ejections led to manual exclusions in Campaign 15 of _K2_ ([_K2_ Data Release 22 Notes](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/doc/drn/KSCI-19138-001_K2-DRN22_C15.pdf), Section 2.2).
