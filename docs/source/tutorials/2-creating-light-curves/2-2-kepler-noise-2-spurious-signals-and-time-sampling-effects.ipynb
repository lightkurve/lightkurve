    "\n",
    "The _Kepler_ space telescope observed the same patch of sky for four continuous years, between 2009 and 2013. Over the course of 18 observing quarters, it collected light curves and pixel data for 150,000 stars in 30-minute Long Cadence mode, and 512 stars per quarter in one-minute Short Cadence mode. Following the failure of two of the telescope's four reaction wheels, the telescope continued as the _K2_ mission, which observed along the ecliptic plane for 20 observing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Kepler_ and _K2_ time series data have been extensively analysed, in both the time domain and the frequency domain. In this tutorial, we'll look at spurious signals — that is, signals introduced by non-astronomical sources — in data from both missions, across simple aperture photometry (SAP) and presearch data conditioning SAP (PDCSAP), as well as in individual pixel time series from target pixel files (TPFs). Many of the effects we'll cover were corrected by the presearch data conditioning (PDC) pipeline, but are still of interest to anyone working closely with pixel data or performing custom photometry.

Where *Kepler* used 40 guide stars throughout the whole mission, in *K2* it was harder to find suitable guide stars in *K2*'s visually crowded fields along the ecliptic plane, and so four stars were used in each campaign. This predictably reduced pointing stability, as each guide star in *K2* contributed more to the overall pointing.\n",
