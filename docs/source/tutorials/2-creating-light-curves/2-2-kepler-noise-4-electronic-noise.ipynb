    "## 2. Crosstalk\n",
    "\n",
    "Crosstalk refers to the phenomenon where an electronic signal from one channel of a device is transferred to another channel and causes noise. In _Kepler_ and _K2_ data, this often manifests as signal from one (usually bright) target appearing elsewhere on the detector. This is known as \"video crosstalk,\" and only has a significant effect when it occurs on the same module, due to the shielding between modules ([_Kepler_ Instrument Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/KSCI-19033-002-instrument-hb.pdf) Section 6.3). _Kepler_ crosstalk can also occur between the CCD modules and the Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS), and between either of these and the onboard clock. However, these kinds of crosstalk are well understood and corrected by the pipeline before data delivery. If you are interested in reading more about these types of crosstalk, they're covered in Sections 6.2 and 6.4 of the [_Kepler_ Instrument Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/KSCI-19033-002-instrument-hb.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what video crosstalk looks like, let's take an example from the _K2_ mission, as documented [here](https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve/issues/160). UGC 7394 (EPIC 200084891) is a galaxy that was observed during _K2_ Campaign 10. Campaign 10 was delivered in two parts, as observation began with a pointing error of 3.5 pixels ([_K2_ Data Release Notes 15](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/doc/drn/KSCI-19131-001_K2-DRN15_C10.pdf), Section 2.1), so when we download our data using Lightkurve we have to specify which file we want.

    "\n",
    "The _Kepler_ detector electronics have a high-frequency noise feature due to circuit self-resonance in the GHz range, which is aliased to lower frequencies by the pixel sampling rate for detector readout. These aliases lead to changing temperatures and pixel sensitivities on the focal plane, which appear as horizontal stripes in motion across on the detector. For a more technical exploration of this phenomenon, see Section 6.7 of the [_Kepler_ Instrument Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/KSCI-19033-002-instrument-hb.pdf).\n",

First we'll download some data, and see if the rolling bands are visible in a cadence taken from before the rolling band passes (left), and after it passes (right).

    "\n",
    "In the first tutorial in this series, we covered cosmic rays as single-cadence quality events. We saw that when a cosmic ray hits a pixel on the detector, it can momentarily increase that pixel's flux reading by injecting noise in between readouts. However, there are multiple other consequences of cosmic rays on the detector that occurred over the course of the _Kepler_ and _K2_ missions.\n",

    "Sudden Pixel Sensitivity Dropout (SPSD) occurs when a cosmic ray _reduces_ the sensitivity of a group of pixels where it lands. SPSD events are categorized as medium-term and long-term (or permanent) damage. In medium-term events, the effected pixels will gradually return to their pre-SPSD sensitivity. Long-term damage would require [annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(metallurgy)) to fix, which could not be done on the _Kepler_ telescope, and as such is materially equivalent to permanent damage. Pixels affected by long-term or permanent damage retained their decreased sensitivity throughout the mission.
