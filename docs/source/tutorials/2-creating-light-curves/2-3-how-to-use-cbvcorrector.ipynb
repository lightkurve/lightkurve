    "Cotrending Basis Vectors (CBVs) are generated in the PDC component of the Kepler/K2/TESS pipeline and are used to remove systematic trends in light curves. They are built from the most common systematic trends observed in each PDC Unit of Work (Quarter for Kepler, Campaign for K2 and Sector for TESS). Each Kepler and K2 module output and each TESS CCD has its own set of CBVs. You can read an introduction to the CBVs in [Demystifying Kepler Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.3093.pdf) or to greater detail in the [Kepler Data Processing Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/KSCI-19081-003-KDPH.pdf). The same basic method to generate CBVs is used for all three missions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides examples of how to utilize the various CBVs to clean lightcurves of common trends experienced by all targets. The technique exploits two goodness metrics that characterize the performance of the fit. `CBVCorrector` inherits the `RegressionCorrector` class in LightKurve, you can find details of that class [here](../api/lightkurve.correctors.RegressionCorrector.html). It is recommend to first read the tutorial on [obtaining the CBVs](https://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials/04-how-to-use-cbvs.html)  before reading this tutorial."

    "- **Single-Scale** contains all systematic trends combined in a single set of basis vectors. \n",

    "- **Multi-Scale** contains systematic trends in specific wavelet-based band passes. There are usually three sets of multi-scale basis vectors in three bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spike** contains only short impulsive spike systematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different correction methods in PDC: Single-Scale and Multi-Scale. Single-Scale performs the correction in a single bandpass. Multi-Scale performs the correction in three separate wavelet-based bandpasses. Both corrections are performed in PDC but we can only export a single PDC light curve for each target. So, PDC must choose which of the two to export on a per-target basis. Generally speaking, single-scale performs better at preserving longer period signals. But at periods close to transiting planet durations multi-scale performs better at preserving signals. PDC therefore mostly chooses multi-scale for use within the planet finding pipeline and for the archive. You can find in the light curve FITS header which PDC method was chosen (keyword “PDCMETHD”). Additionally, a seperate correction is alway performed to remove short impulsive systematic spikes.\n",

    "For an individual's research needs, the mission supplied PDC lightcurves might not be ideal and so the CBVs are provided to the user to perform their own correction. All three CBV types are provided at MAST for TESS, however only Single-Scale is provided at MAST for Kepler and K2. Also for Kepler and K2, Cotrending Basis Vectors are supplied for only the 30-minute target cadence."

    "Two very common issues when fitting a model to a data set it over-fitting and under-fitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over-fitting occurs when the model has too many degrees of freedom and fits the data  _at all costs_, instead of just modelling the physical process it is attempting to model. This can exhibit itself in different ways, depending on the system and application. In the case of fitting systematic trend basis vectors to a time series, over-fitting can result in the basis vectors removing intrinsic signals in the times series instead of just the systematics. It can also result in introduced broad-band noise. This can be particularily prominant in an unconstrained least-squares fit. A least-squares fit only cares about minimizing it's loss function, which is the Root Mean Square error. In the course of minimizing the RMS, narrow-band power representing the systematic trends are exchanged for broad-band noise intrinsic in the basis vectors. This results in the overall RMS decreasing but the noise in the time series increasing, resulting in the obscuration of the signals under interest. A very common method to inhibit over-fitting is to introduce a regularization term in the loss function. This constrains the fit and effectively reduces the degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under-fitting occurs when the model has too few degrees of freedom and fails to adequately model the physical process it is attempting to model. In the case of fitting systematic trend basis vectors to a time series, under-fitting can result in residual systematics. Under-fitting can either be the result of the basis vectors not adequately representing the systematics or, placing too great of a restriction on the model during fitting. The regularization technique used to inhibit over-fitting can therefore result in under-fitting. The ideal fit will balance the counter-acting phenomena of over- and under-fitting. To this end, a method can be developed to measure the degree to which these two phenomena occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "PDC has two **Goodness Metrics** to assess over- and under-fitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Over-fitting metric**: Measures the introduced noise in the light curve after the correction. It does so by measuring the broad-band power spectrum via a Lomb-Scargle Periodogram both before and after the correction. If power has increased after the correction then this is an indication the CBV fit has over-fitted and introduced noise. The metric treats all frequencies equally when measuring power increase; from one frequency separation to the Nyquist frequency. This metric is callibrated such that a metric value of 0.5 means the introduced noise due to over-fitting is at the same power level as the uncertainties in the light curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Under-fitting metric**: Measures the mean residual target to target Pearson correlation between the target under study and a selection of neighboring targets. This metric will find and download a selection of neighboring SPOC SAP targets in RA and Decl. until a minimum number is found. The metric is callibrated such that a value of 0.95 means the residual correlations in the target is equivalent to chance correlations of White Gaussian Noise.\n",

We also utilize the `correct_elasticnet` corrector, which allows us to add in a L1-Norm term (Lasso Regularization). L1-Norm helps snap some basis vector fit coefficients to zero and can result in a more stable, less noisy fit. The result is a much better compromise between over- and under-fitting. The spikes are not well removed but increasing the weight on the Spike CBV removal results in over-fitting. We can also try the multi-scale band 3 CBVs, which contain high frequency systematics, but the over-fitting metric indicates using them results in even greater over-fitting.

A second argument, `extrapolate_cbvs`, can be used to also extrapolate the CBV values to the light curve cadences.
