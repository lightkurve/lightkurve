    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [*K2*](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2) and [*TESS*](https://archive.stsci.edu/tess) missions both provide high-precision photometry for thousands of exoplanet candidates. However, observations by both telescopes can be muddled by instrumental systematic trends, making exoplanet detection or stellar characterization difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD) is a method that has primarily been used to remove systematic trends introduced by small spacecraft motions during observations, and has been shown to be successful at improving the precision of data taken by the *Spitzer* space telescope ([Deming et al. 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...805..132D/abstract)) and the *K2* mission ([Luger et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....152..100L/abstract); [2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....156...99L/abstract)). PLD works by identifying a set of trends in the pixels surrounding the target star, and performing linear regression to create a combination of these trends that effectively models the systematic noise introduced by spacecraft motion. This noise model is then subtracted from the uncorrected light curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method has been shown to be very effective at removing the periodic systematic trends in *K2*, and can also help remove the scattered light background signal in *TESS* observations. This tutorial will demonstrate how to use the [Lightkurve](https://docs.lightkurve.org) [PLDCorrector](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.correctors.PLDCorrector.html?highlight=pldcorrector) for each mission, and will give advice on how to best implement PLD.

    "\n",
    "The dominant source of noise in *K2* data is created by the motion of the *Kepler* spacecraft due to periodic thruster firings. This causes stars to drift across different pixels on the detector, which have varied sensitivity. There are two classes of sensitivity variation on a charge-couped device (CCD) detector â€” variation between pixels (inter-pixel) and variation within each pixel (intra-pixel). Both inter- and intra-pixel sensitivity variations are present on the *Kepler* detector, which ultimately causes different flux levels to be detected as the target's Point Spread Function (PSF) drifts across the variations, introducing the systematic trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [PLDCorrector](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.correctors.PLDCorrector.html?highlight=pldcorrector) uses information from nearby pixels to create a noise model, so we need to use the [TargetPixelFile](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/targetpixelfile.html?highlight=targetpixelfile) data product (for more information, see the tutorial on using *Kepler* target pixel file products). We can use the [search_targetpixelfile](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.search_targetpixelfile.html?highlight=search_targetpixelfile) method to identify available observations for the desired target, and the [download](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/search.html?highlight=download) method to access the data.\n",

    "In the example above, it looks like PLD did a great job of removing the instrumental noise introduced by the *K2* detector drift, but the bottom panel of the diagnostic plot seems to indicate that we've falsely labeled in-transit data points as outliers. To alleviate this, we can introduce the `cadence_mask`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "It's necessary to mask out transits and flares when fitting the spline. The spline term fits a polynomial to the long-term trend of the light curve, and the highest likelihood solution generally follows the median of the corrected light curve. The presence of transits or flares can pull the median of the light curve down or up, respectively, causing the spline to deviate from the underlying stellar trend. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this causes transits to be partially \"fit out\" by the spline, reducing their depth and giving an incorrect estimate of the planet's radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a custom `cadence_mask` by creating a Boolean array with one value per cadence, where `True` indicates a cadence you wish to include and `False` means that the cadence is masked out.\n",

    "## 6. Frequently Asked Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**How should I select the pixels to use?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown earlier, there are three aperture masks used in the `PLDCorrector`. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `aperture_mask`: Used to create the SAP flux light curve from which the noise model is subtracted. For this aperture, you should select as many pixels as possible that only contain flux from the target star. This is done automatically using a threshold mask, but it is a good idea to examine that mask with the [diagnose_masks](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.correctors.PLDCorrector.diagnose_masks.html?highlight=diagnose_masks#lightkurve.correctors.PLDCorrector.diagnose_masks) method to ensure it does not include background targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `background_aperture_mask`: Pixels used to create the background model. These pixels should not contain flux from the target star whose light curve you are attempting to correct, nor should it contain flux from background targets. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `pld_aperture_mask`: Pixels used to create the correlated noise model. This aperture mask is more difficult to define, and may change on a case-by-case basis. For *K2*, this mask should contain as many pixels as possible in order to best capture the persistent motion-generated noise. For *TESS*, this mask should have less of an impact than the background mask, but should include all pixels in the cutout that do not contain background stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How can I speed up the correction?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The spline [DesignMatrix](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.correctors.DesignMatrix.html?highlight=designmatrix#lightkurve.correctors.DesignMatrix) used in [PLDCorrector](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.correctors.PLDCorrector.html?highlight=pldcorrector) can be substituted for a [SparseDesignMatrix](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.correctors.SparseDesignMatrix.html?highlight=sparsedesignmatrix). These behave identically to traditional `DesignMatrix` objects, but use `scipy.sparse` to speed up calculation and reduce memory. This can be done by passing in `sparse=True` to the `correct` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What do I do if I get a singular matrix error?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A singular matrix error occurs when a matrix used in [RegressionCorrector](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.correctors.RegressionCorrector.html?highlight=regressioncorrector) cannot be inverted, a step necessary for optimizing the coefficients. The primary reason this occurs is that the input `DesignMatrix` has low rank relative to the number of column vectors. There are two suggested solutions to this issue:\n",
    "*  Limit the number of input column vectors by performing Principle Component Analysis (PCA). This is done automatically in `PLDCorrector`, but the number of output PCA vectors can be reduced using the `pca_components` keyword in the `correct` method from its default value of 16.\n",
    "* Ensure you are not masking out too much of your data. For instance, if you are using the `cadence_mask`, make sure that the values you want to include in your detrending are labeled as `True`. Using the inverse `cadence_mask` will often raise a singular matrix error."
