    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The brightnesses of stars can oscillate — that is, vary over time — for many different reasons. For example, in the companion tutorials we explored light curves that oscillated due to an eclipsing binary pair transiting in front of one another, and we looked at a star that showed variability due to star spots on its surface rotating in and out of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on *intrinsic* oscillators: stars that exhibit variability due to processes inside the stars. For example, one of these internal processes is the presence of standing waves trapped in the interior. When the light curve of a star is transformed into the frequency domain, such waves can be observed as distinct peaks in the frequency spectrum of the star. The branch of astronomy that focuses on studying these signals is called [*asteroseismology*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroseismology).\n",
    "\n",
    "Asteroseismology is an important tool because it allows intrinsic properties of a star, such as its mass and radius, to be estimated from the light curve alone. The only requirement is that the quality of the light curve — its duration, sampling, and precision — must be good enough to provide a high-resolution view of the star in the frequency domain. *Kepler* data is particularly well-suited for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore two types of intrinsic oscillators that are commonly studied by asteroseismologists: \n",
    "1. [**$\\delta$ Scuti stars**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Scuti_variable): a class of oscillating stars typically 1.5 to 2.5 times as massive as the Sun, which oscillate due to fluctuations in the opacity of the outer layers of the star.\n",
    "2. **Solar-Like Oscillators**: a class that includes all stars that oscillate in the same manner as the Sun, namely due to turbulent motion in the convective outer layers of their atmospheres. This includes both main sequence stars as well as red giant stars.\n",

    "Compared to the $\\delta$ Scuti, the modes of oscillation in the figure above are less sharp, even though we used much more data to create the periodogram. This is because the modes in solar-like oscillators are damped due to the turbulent motion of the convective envelope. This lowers their amplitudes and also causes the lifetimes of the oscillations to be short. The short lifetimes create some uncertainty around the exact oscillation frequency, and so the peaks that appear in the periodogram are a little broader (usually Lorentzian-like in shape). This may not be immediately apparant from these figures, but is much clearer if you zoom in on an individual mode."

    "In the figure above, the smoothed periodogram is plotted over the top of the original periodogram. In this case we have used the [Astropy `Box1DKernel`](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.convolution.Box1DKernel.html) filter, with a filter width of $0.5\\, \\mu \\rm{Hz}$. The filter takes the median value of power in a region $0.5\\, \\mu \\rm{Hz}$ around a data point, and replaces that point with the median value. It then moves on to the next data point. This creates a smoothed periodogram of the same length as the original. Because the power values are now correlated, these smoothed periodograms usually aren't used for computational analysis, but they can aid visual explorations of the location of the oscillation modes."
