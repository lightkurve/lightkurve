    "You can use `lightkurve` to extract a lightcurve of transient phenomena, including supernovae. Supernovae data analysis presents a few unique challenges compared to data analysis of isolated point sources.  We can anticipate some of the common limitations of the Kepler pipeline-processed lightcurves, which make no attempt to hone-in on supernovae.  For example, the supernova resides in a host galaxy which may itself be time variable due to, *e.g.*, active galactic nuclei (AGN).  Common detrending methods, such as \"Self Flat Fielding\" ([SFF](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sff/)) assume that centroid shifts are due entirely to undesired motion of the spacecraft, while transients induce bona-fide astrophysical centroid motion as the postage-stamp photocenter gets weighted towards the increasingly luminous transient's photocenter. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will custom-make a custom supernova lightcurve with these simple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an appropriate aperture mask to isolate the transient from its host galaxy\n",
    "2. Extract aperture photometry of both the supernova and the background attributable to the host galaxy  \n",
    "3. Apply \"Self Flat Fielding\" (SFF) detrending techniques  \n",
    "4. Plot the lightcurve\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on an unusual class of transient recently observed in K2, the so-called *Fast-Evolving Luminous Transients* or **FELT**s.  These transients rise and fall within a mere few days, much shorter than conventional supernovae, which can last hundreds of days.  The discovery of **KSN2015k** was recently reported by [Rest et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-018-0423-2) and summarized in at least two press releases from [STSci](http://hubblesite.org/news_release/news/2018-18) and [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7086).\n",

I used [interact()](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.KeplerTargetPixelFile.interact.html?highlight=interact#lightkurve.KeplerTargetPixelFile.interact) with a fine-tuned screen-stretch to see that the FELT appears near pixel column 830, row 231.
