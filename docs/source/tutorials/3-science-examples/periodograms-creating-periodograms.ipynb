    "\n",
    "The [*Kepler*](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html) and [*TESS*](https://tess.mit.edu/) telescopes observe stars for long periods of time, from just under a month to four years. By doing so they observe how the brightnesses of stars change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some signals that appear in these time series will form repeating patterns. In other words, they oscillate. These oscillations are better studied in frequency space, through the means of a *periodogram*. This tutorial provides an explanation of what a periodogram is, and how you can use Lightkurve's tools to study a *Kepler* observation in the frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stars of all shapes, sizes, and ages experience changes in brightness. This variability repeats over time, forming oscillation signals that we can observe in *Kepler* data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stellar brightness variability can have various sources. Some stars will vary in brightness due to star spots rotating in and out of view. Others pulsate, shrinking and expanding due to waves forming inside of the star. And still others may vary in brightness due to interaction with a nearby companion. By understanding the stellar variability, we can learn a lot about the conditions on, within, and around the star itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because stellar variablity produces oscillating signals, and *Kepler* data can span up to four years, it is often cumbersome to study these oscillations in the time domain. Instead, we can study them in the frequency domain, where signals are separated into bins of frequency, and strong repeating patterns are more readily discerned.\n"

    " An eclipsing binary is a pair of stars which orbit one another in such a way that they periodically eclipse each other with respect to us, the observers. The eclipse produces a repeating pattern of two \"dips\" per orbit, creating a rich pattern of ups and downs in the light curve. These stars [show up frequently](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/3/68) in *Kepler* observations.

    "While at first glance it may look like there are lots of different signals, the repeating, evenly spaced peaks in this instance are likely *alias harmonics* of the true oscillation frequency. Harmonics are integer multiples of the oscillation frequency. They occur when a light curve is finite in duration or contains gaps, in which case it is common for a DFT to identify integer multiples as additional candidate signals. For example, an eclipse with a period of 10 days can easily be mistaken for an eclipse with a period of 20 days, in particular when the data contains gaps near the transit times. The [Vanderplas (2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09824.pdf) paper provides a detailed explanation of this phenomenon.\n",

All of the harmonic peaks are of the same origin — the period of the star — but only one of them represents the truth. In what follows below, we will demonstrate a trial and error method to identify the true peak."

    "Finding the period of this eclipsing binary is all good and well, but it's not yet very precise, as the [fold()](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.LightCurve.fold.html?highlight=fold) plot indicates. Using keyword arguments of the [to_periodogram()](https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.LightCurve.to_periodogram.html?highlight=to_periodogram) function, we can improve this estimate. Try one or both of the following:\n",
    "- Use the `minimum_period` and `maximum_period` arguments to limit the range of the periodogram to the area around the peak we are interested in.\n",
    "- Increase the `oversample_factor` argument from the default value of 1, which increases the resolution of the periodogram (this is at the expense of correlating the power values, but that is not a problem for the type of analysis we're doing here).\n",

    "Tip: you can plot a periodogram in power-period space by using `plot(view='period')`."
