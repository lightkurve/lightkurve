    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is part of a series on handling _Kepler_ and _K2_ data with Astropy and Lightkurve. To work through this tutorial, you should be familiar with downloading and handling both **light curves** and **target pixel files** with Lightkurve, and you should have experience working with **periodograms**. We'll use light curves and periodograms to detect signal, and follow that up with detailed analysis on the pixel scale to pinpoint the signal's source.\n",

    "Some useful terms to keep in mind when working with signal verification are _contamination_ and _blending_. These terms are often used interchangeably. Here, we'll use blending to refer to any scenario where flux from two or more targets become visible in one target's aperture. We use contamination to refer, more specifically, to the signal that erroneously enters the aperture."

    "\n",
    "The _Kepler_ space telescope observed with 4x4 arcsecond square pixels. This means that if two stars are within the same _Kepler_ pixel, it is difficult to identify which is the source of an observed signal. Fortunately, these coincidences are unlikely. But the _Kepler_ mission observed areas close to the Galactic plane, and both _Kepler_ and _K2_ observed stellar clusters, all of which are visually crowded regions. Due to crowding, there are still many cases where the true source of a signal is unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of signal verification begins with a light curve: first, we must detect our signal. In the case of potential exoplanet transits, these will be evident in the light curve; for other phenomena, including binarity and stellar variability, we might need a periodogram to pick up on the signal. To make sure our transits really do belong to a planet, or if there's any uncertainty about the source of a stellar signal (such as, is the star in a crowded region? Is there a bright star nearby? Are we seeing multiple signals?), we need to look at the target pixel files, which will give us a more complete picture, and help us identify nearby contaminating sources."

This is often something we can check by eye; here, we can confirm that the signal is coming from our target star, KIC 2435971.

    "The focus of most _Kepler_ and _K2_ signal verification research has been in validating exoplanets. Often, this is done by measuring and tracking image centroids. A centroid is the weighted average along both axes of the image, which measures the point where most flux is concentrated. If a true transit is observed, the centroid of the image will shift in time with it ([Batalha et al., 2010](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/713/2/L103/pdf)). Another technique, and the focus of this section, is difference imaging ([Bryson et al., 2013](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/671767/pdf)). Difference imaging has been used to validate signals from exocomets ([Rappaport et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06069.pdf)), flaring stars ([Yang et al., 2017](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa8ea2/pdf)), and binary systems ([Colman et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.00621.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "For vetting exoplanet candidates, difference imaging begins with a selection of flux measurements, both in- and out-of-phase with the transit. Using the frames from TPF images, we take an average of each collection of frames and subtract the in-phase fluxes from the out-of-phase fluxes, resulting in a _difference image_. We can then measure the centroid of the difference image, which will move outside of the optimal aperture if the star is contaminated. We can also visually identify the pixel where the variable flux is \"brightest.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to work through a basic case here, which is applicable to a broad variety of stellar signals. For any periodic and quasi-sinusoidal signal, difference imaging works by selecting flux frames at timestamps around the maxima and minima of the signal, which is equivalent to working in- and out-of-phase with a transit. The result is a pixel image where the brightest pixels are those where the periodic signal is strongest.\n",

But for difference imaging to work well, we need as much data as possible to extract the period for differencing, so we'll use the stitched light curve we prepared earlier. We've already downloaded the data above, so let's remind ourselves of what the periodogram looks like:"

In many cases, it will suffice not to set the argument at all. An alternative to experimenting with the epoch time is appending the phased light curve to itself, which guarantees at least one clear maximum and one clear minimum. This is a better method for an automated difference imaging pipeline, but is more complicated to implement."

    "Let's take a moment to think about what these images tell us. In the average image, we can see our two stars, the target and the brighter star at the top of the frame. In the difference image, the pixel with the highest difference flux is one of the central pixels, indicating that the signal is coming from the target star, just as we saw when we looked at pixel-level periodograms with `plot_pixels()`.\n",

    "We can still see a little bit of signal in some other pixels. This is down to noise, which we saw in our first folded light curve. Even with a clear signal like the one from KIC 2435971, most difference images will show some degree of noise. But it's good to note that the difference flux in the pixel that hosts the bright nearby star is greatly diminished, as we would expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, since we can get this information from `plot_pixels()`, why would we want to go to the effort of difference imaging? Sometimes the signal in a periodogram may not be visually clear from using `plot_pixels()`, but there would still be enough signal for it to show up in a difference image. Difference imaging is also useful for clarifying association in a crowded field, or where bright stars are involved. If a signal is spread out across a lot of pixels, difference imaging can pinpoint where it's strongest; this is particularly evident in the case of KIC 2435971. And of course, it's always good to confirm our conclusions using a different method!"
