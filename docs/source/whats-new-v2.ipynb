    "## Lightkurve 2 offers improved support for TESS\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightkurve v1 has been a tremendous success.  Owing to the efforts of [67 contributors](https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve/blob/master/AUTHORS.rst), Lightkurve grew into a popular tool to analyze the data archive of NASA's Kepler space telescope.  The package has been cited by nearly [200 scientific publications](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=full%3A\"Lightkurve\") to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the success revealed a shortcoming: Lightkurve 1 was too focused on supporting Kepler data products. Over the past two years, our community has evolved in important ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* NASA successfully launched TESS, adding a significant new data set which requires Lightkurve-like tools.\n",
    "* The TESS data archive started hosting numerous [community light curve databases](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/community.html#high-level-science-products) created using specialized pipelines.\n",
    "* Many new time domain missions are on the horizon, including NASA's Roman Space Telescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "In response to these changes, the [TESS GI Office](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/) at NASA Goddard and the [TESS Data Archive](https://archive.stsci.edu/tess/) at STScI/MAST supported the modification of Lightkurve and its tutorials to better support TESS and other data sets in three important ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. LightCurve objects are now specialized kinds of AstroPy Table objects, making it a more generic container for light curves from any telescope.\n",
    "2. Data search and download functions now support all TESS and Kepler light curve available at MAST, including those created by community pipelines.\n",
    "3. The noise removal tools now allow users to perform custom corrections in a way that is very similar to the official TESS pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this page briefly demonstrates these new features.\n",
    "They are explained in more detail in a new set of entry-level tutorials which are avaiable in the online documentation at [docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials](https://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. LightCurve objects are now specialized kinds of AstroPy Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important change in Lightkurve 2 is that light curves are now extensions of AstroPy [TimeSeries](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/timeseries/) objects, which in turn are a sub-class of AstroPy Table.\n",
    "Compared to a generic table, the key difference is that each `LightCurve` object is guaranteed to have `time`, `flux`, and `flux_err` columns. This allows Lightkurve to extend AstroPy with tools that are specific to the analysis of TESS-like time series photometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ New: LightCurve objects behave like tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Light curves can still be created as before, but now look and act like tables:"

    "## FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I install Lightkurve 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can upgrade Lightkurve using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m pip install --upgrade lightkurve\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I keep using Lightkurve 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can continue to use Lightkurve 1 by pinning the version number using pip, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m pip install lightkurve==1.11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Will existing Lightkurve code break?\n",
    "\n",
    "While we tried to maximize backwards compatibility, Lightkurve 2 does contain a small number of changes that may break existing code for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **lc.time is now always an Astropy Time object.**  Unfortunately, many NumPy and SciPy functions do not deal seamlessly with `Time` objects yet. Existing code may have to be modified to pass `lc.time.value` to NumPy/SciPy functions where `lc.time` was passed before.\n",
    "2. **Other numerical columns are now Astropy Quantity objects.**  While Quantity objects are largely compatible with NumPy/SciPy, situations do arise where users may wish to perform operations on `lc.flux.value` instead of `lc.flux`.\n",
    "3. **All metadata is now stored in the lc.meta dictionary**.  This includes any header values of the FITS file from which a light curve was loaded.  For convenience, we continue to support attribute access, e.g. `lc.sector` is available as a shortcut for `lc.meta['SECTOR']`.\n",
    "4. **LightCurveFile classes have been deprecated.** Instead, light curve files can now be loaded using `LightCurve.read(filename, format=\"tess\")`.\n",
    "5. **lc.time can no longer contain NaN values**.  This is because AstroPy Time objects do not currently support NaN values. As a result, light curve reading functions will tend to ignore rows with NaN time values. All other columns in a light curve continue to support NaNs values however.\n",
    "6. **lc.bin() now takes time_bin_size and time_bin_start arguments.** This is for consistency with `astropy.timeseries.aggregate_downsample`. This significantly alters the behavior of binning, because bins are now defined in time instead of by number of data points.\n",
    "7. **lc.fold() now returns un-normalized phase values by default.**  This is for consistency with `TimeSeries.fold()`. For the same reason, the `t0` argument has been deprecated in favor of `epoch_time`, and the method now accepts the extra `epoch_phase`, `wrap_phase`, and `normalize_phase` arguments.\n",
    "8. **Several attributes and methods have been deprecated.**  They still work but will yield a warning and may be removed in the future:\n",
    "  * `lc.astropy_time` => `lc.time`\n",
    "  * `lc.time_format` => `lc.time.format`\n",
    "  * `lc.time_scale` => `lc.time.scale`\n",
    "  * `lc.flux_quantity` => `lc.flux`\n",
    "  * `lc.flux_unit` => `lc.flux.unit`\n",
    "  * `search_lightcurvefile()` => `search_lightcurve()`"
