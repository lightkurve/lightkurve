    def estimate_numax(self, method="acf", numaxs=None, window=None, spacing=None):
        """Estimates the peak of the envelope of seismic oscillation modes,
        numax using an autocorrelation function. There are many papers on the
        topic of autocorrelation functions for estimating seismic parameters,
        including but not limited to: Roxburgh & Vorontsov (2006),
        Roxburgh (2009), Mosser & Appourchaux (2009), Huber et al. (2009),
        Verner & Roxburgh (2011) & Viani et al. (2019).

        We base this approach first and foremost off the 2D ACF numax estimation
        presented in Viani et al. (2019) and other papers above. A window of
        fixed width (either given by the user, 25 microhertz for Red Giants or
        250 microhertz for Main Sequence stars) is moved along the power
        spectrum, where the central frequency of the window moves in steps of 1
        microhertz (or given by the user as `spacing`) and evaluates the
        autocorrelation at each step.

        The correlation (numpy.correlate) is typically given as:

        C[x, y] = sum( x * conj(y) ) .

        The autocorrelation power of a full spectrum with itself is then

        C = sum(s * s),

        where s is a window of the signal-to-noise spectrum.
        In order to evaluate where the correlation power is highest (indicative
        of the power excess of the modes) we calculate the Mean Collapsed
        Correlation (MCC, see Kiefer 2013, Viani et al. 2019) as

        MCC = (sum(|C|) - 1) / nlags ,

        where C is the autocorrelation power at a given central freqeuncy, and
        nlags is the number of lags in the autocorrelation.

        The MCC metric is covolved with an Astropy Gaussian 1D Kernel with a
        standard deviation of 1/5th of the window size to smooth it. The
        frequency that results in the highest value of the smoothed MCC is the
        detected numax.

        NOTE: This method is not robust against large peaks in the spectrum (due
        to e.g. spacecraft rotation), nor is it robust in the case of low signal
        to noise (such as for single sector TESS data). Exercise caution when
        using this module!

        NOTE: This function is intended for use with solar like Main Sequence
        and Red Giant Branch oscillators only.

        Parameters
        ----------
        numaxs : array-like
            An array of numaxs at which to evaluate the autocorrelation. If
            none is given, a sensible range will be chosen. If no units are
            given it is assumed to be in the same units as the periodogram
            frequency.
        window : int or float
            The width of the autocorrelation window around each central
            frequency in 'numaxs'. If none is given, a sensible value will be
            chosen. If no units are given it is assumed to be in the same units
            as the periodogram frequency.
        spacing : int or float
            The spacing between central frequencies (numaxs) at which the
            autocorrelation is evaluated. If none is given, a sensible value
            will be assumed. If no units are given it is assumed to be in the
            same units as the periodogram frequency.

        Returns

        functions for estimating seismic parameters, including but not limited

        Mosser & Appourchaux (2009), Huber et al. (2009),
        Verner & Roxburgh (2011) & Viani et al. (2019).

        We base this approach first and foremost off the approach taken in
        Mosser & Appourchaux (2009). Given a known numax, a window around this
        numax is taken of one estimated full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the
        seismic mode envelope either side of numax. This width is chosen so that
        the autocorrelation includes all of the visible mode peaks.

        The autocorrelation (numpy.correlate) is given as:

        C = sum(s * s)

        where s is a window of the signal-to-noise spectrum. When shifting
        the spectrum over itself, C will increase when two mode peaks are
        overlapping.

        As is done in Mosser & Appourchaux, we rescale the value of C in terms
        of the noise level in the ACF spectrum as

        A = |C^2| / |C[0]^2|) * (2 * len(C) / 3) .

        The method will autocorrelate the region around the estimated numax
        expected to contain seismic oscillation modes. Repeating peaks in the
        autocorrelation implies an evenly spaced structure of modes.
        The peak closest to an empirical estimate of deltanu is taken as the true
        value. The peak finding algorithm is limited by a minimum spacing
        between peaks of 0.5 times the empirical value for deltanu.

        Our empirical estimate for numax is taken from Stello et al. (2009) as

        deltanu = 0.294 * numax^0.772

        If `numax` is None, a numax is calculated using the estimate_numax()
        function with default settings.

        NOTE: This function is intended for use with solar like Main Sequence
        and Red Giant Branch oscillators only.
