    envelope), the expected Full Width Half Maximum of the envelope is known
    as a function of numax for evolved Red Giant Branch stars as follows

    If the maximum frequency in the periodogram is less than 500 microhertz,

    is dealing with an RGB star, which oscillate at lower frequencies.

    If the maximum frequency is above 500 microhertz, the envelope is given
    as a different function of numax (see Lund et al. 2017), as

    fwhm = 0.25 * numax,

    star, which oscillate at higher frequencies.

    numax : float
