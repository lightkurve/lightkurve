    envelope), the expected Full Width Half Maximum of the envelope is known
    as a function of numax for evolved Red Giant Branch stars as follows
    (see Mosser et al 2010):

    fwhm = 0.66 * numax^0.88 .

    If the maximum frequency in the periodogram is less than 500 microhertz,
    this function will default to the above equation under the assumption it
    is dealing with an RGB star, which oscillate at lower frequencies.

    If the maximum frequency is above 500 microhertz, the envelope is given
    as a different function of numax (see Lund et al. 2017), as

    fwhm = 0.25 * numax,

    in which case the function assumes it is dealing with a main sequence
    star, which oscillate at higher frequencies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    numax : float
        The estimated position of the numax of the power spectrum. This
        is used to calculated the region autocorrelated with itself.

    We autocorrelate a region with a width of `window_width` (in microhertz)
    around a central frequency `numax` (in microhertz). The window size is
    determined based on the location of the nyquist frequency when
    estimating numax, and based on the expected width of the mode envelope
    of the asteroseismic oscillations when calculating deltanu. The section of
    power being autocorrelated is first resclaed by subtracting its mean, so
    that its noise is centered around zero. If this is not done, noise will
    appear in the ACF as a function of 1/lag.

    ----------
        numax : float
