class DR38BackgroundBiasIssueCorrector(Corrector):
    """During TESS's primary mission relatively dim and/or crowded target stars
    were often subject to overestimated background levels, which would result 
    in underestimated flux values and therefore overestimated transit depths.
    In Sector 27 a procedure was added to improve the accuracy of the 
    background correction. 

    This update has been applied to all 2-minute and  20-second targets. 
    Previous Sector data however, has not been corrected.
    While the change in the background estimates and relative transit depths 
    is generally small (< 2% for transit depths and < 1% for planet radii), 
    for some dim and/or crowded targets the effect is larger. Please see data 
    release note 38 for sector 27 for more detail (pgs. 9 and 10, link - 
    https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/doc/tess_drn/tess_sector_27_drn38_v02.pdf).

    This corrector class calculate the scaler offset (pdcCorrection) to apply 
    to the PDCSAP_FLUX in Years 1 and 2, to correct for the measured background
    bias. It also calculates the predicted bias (transitBias) in the transit 
    depth given the bias in the background estimate. This value is diagnostic 
    only, but useful in determining if the background bias is significant for a
    given target object.

    Note that the correction should only be applied to files before data release 38, 
    whih have not yet been re-processed. To determine which data release your data 
    was generated from please examine the meta data key word 'DATA_REL'.

    The correction works by first removing potentially problematic pixels from 
    the background pixel sample. It then calculates the median flux of 
    each remaining pixel in the TPF. 
    The median pixel values are then sorted and the one with the third lowest
    value is selected - this is bgBias value.

    Next the CROWSAP and FLFRCSAP keyvalues are used to calculate the pdc 
    correction via pdcCorrection = bgBias*nPix*CROWDSAP/FLFRCSAP - where nPix
    is the number of pixels in the SPOC defined optimal aperture. This value 
    is added to the PDCSAP flux.

    Then the transitBias value is calculated via dividing the correction by 
    the median value of the PDCSAP_FLUX time series.

    Download the TPF file and the PDCSAP lightcurve for TOI-824
    then correct it for the background:

    >>> lcf = lk.search_lightcurve('TOI-824', author='SPOC', sector=11).download()
    >>> bg = DR38BackgroundBiasIssueCorrector(tpf, lcf)
    >>> bgBias, pdcCorrection, transitBias, corrected_lc = bg.correct()"""
