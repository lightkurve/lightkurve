    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [*Kepler*](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler), [*K2*](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2), and [*TESS*](https://archive.stsci.edu/tess) telescopes observe stars for long periods of time, from just under a month to four years. By doing so they observe how the brightness of stars change over time. A series of these brightness observations is referred to as a [light curve](https://www.nasa.gov/kepler/education/lightcurves/) of a star.\n",
    "\n",
    "Light curves of stars observed by the *Kepler*, *K2*, or *TESS* missions are created from the raw images collected by these telescopes using software built for this purpose by the mission teams. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the Lightkurve package to download these preprocessed light curves from *Kepler*'s data archive, plot them, and understand their properties and units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the explanation below is inspired by [Kinemuchi et al. (2012)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.3093.pdf), an excellent paper introducing and explaining the terminology surrounding the *Kepler* mission and its data. You can find detailed information on the mission and its data products in the official [*Kepler* Instrument Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/KSCI-19033-002-instrument-hb.pdf) and the [*Kepler* Data Processing Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/KSCI-19081-003-KDPH.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the *Kepler* mission as the main example, but these tools are extensible to *TESS* and *K2* as well. For example, while in this tutorial we will learn to work with Lightkurve's `KeplerLightCurve` objects, there are also `TessLightCurve` objects that work in the same way."

    "\n",
    "During its nominal mission, the *Kepler* telescope made observations using 21 pairs of rectangular charge-coupled device (CCD) camera chips (also called *modules*), each consisting of four 1100 x 2048 pixel *channels*. Each observed star fell on one of these 84 CCD channels. Recording the channel numbers for each star was important, because the *Kepler* spacecraft rotated by 90 degrees roughly four times a year. These rotations divide what are referred to as observing *quarters*. While the same star may be observed in multiple quarters, it may fall on a different CCD channel each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Kepler* observed a single field in the sky, although not all stars in this field were recorded as light curves. Instead, pixels were selected around a predetermined list of target stars, which were then downloaded. These downloaded measurements are stored in *target pixel files* (TPFs). By adding up the flux (a measurement of an object's brightness per unit time) measured by the pixels in which a target star appears, the total brightness of a star can be measured. If you make this measurement at different times, you obtain a light curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Kepler* recorded the brightness measurements at two different cadences: a Short Cadence (SC, 58.85 seconds) and a Long Cadence (LC, 29.4 minutes). For more details, read: [*Kepler* Instrument Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/KSCI-19033-002-instrument-hb.pdf), Section 2.1. *Mission Overview* and 2.6. *Pixels of Interest*, and the [*Kepler* Archive Manual](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/k2/_documents/MAST_Kepler_Archive_Manual_2020.pdf) Chapter 2: *Kepler* Data Products.\n",

Instead, it changed its focus to the ecliptic plane, and performed 80-day observing campaigns of 19 separate fields. *K2* data are very similar to *Kepler* data, but are subject to higher levels of instrument noise due to the increased instability of the spacecraft.

The data it collects are very similar to those from *Kepler* and *K2*, but *TESS* covers a much larger area of the sky at a lower resolution. *TESS* observes large sectors of the sky for 27 days at a time. The overlap of these sectors means that stars near the ecliptic poles will receive a year of uninterrupted data, while those near the ecliptic receive only ~27 days. Compared to *Kepler*, *TESS* observes in several different cadence modes, including 20 seconds, 120 seconds, 10 minutes, and 30 minutes. For more details, see the [Mission Overview](https://tess.mit.edu/science/) and the [*TESS* Instrument Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/active-missions/tess/_documents/TESS_Instrument_Handbook_v0.1.pdf), specifically *Section 2: Introduction to TESS*.\n",

Because the SAP light curve is a sum of the brightness in chosen pixels, it is still subject to systematic artifacts of the mission.\n",

For most inspections, a PDCSAP light curve is what you want to use, but when looking at astronomical phenomena that aren't planets (for example, long-term variability), the SAP flux may be preferred."

The *time scale* indicates how the time is measured, in this case by taking the Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). This detailed information may be important when comparing observations of a periodic event (such as a planet transit) with observations made with other telescopes on Earth."
