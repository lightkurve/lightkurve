    "\n",
    "Stars of all shapes and sizes oscillate. In many cases, these oscillations are created by standing waves formed inside of the star, which disturb the stellar surface. The study of these types of internal oscillations is called *asteroseismology*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on a very common type of oscillating star: *solar-like oscillators*. This type includes main sequence stars like the Sun as well as many red giant stars. Stars of this type experience convection in the outer layers of their atmospheres. As material moves up and down in these layers, the turbulent motion forms damped standing waves throughout the stellar interior. Because these waves probe the full stellar interior, we can estimate fundamental properties of a star by studying how these waves disturb the surface of the star. Properties which can be inferred in this way include mass, radius, surface gravity, and even age for the most advanced studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will explain two key metrics asteroseismologists use to characterize the oscillations of a Sun-like star: the average frequency spacing $\\Delta\\nu$, and the frequency of maximum oscillation amplitude $\\nu_{\\rm max}$. We will also demonstrate how these metrics can be used to estimate the mass, radius, and surface gravity of a star."

    "In this tutorial, we have seen how Lightkurve's tools can be used to estimate the mass, radius, and surface gravity of a solar-like oscillator. We did this by first estimating the seismic observables $\\nu_{\\rm max}$ and $\\Delta\\nu$. \n",
    "It is important to remember, however, that these are *estimates*, and that the method built into Lightkurve is an adaptation of established 2D ACF methods designed to provide first look estimates of stellar properties. Lightkurve's implementation has not been tested thoroughly in the literature yet, and it does not provide uncertainties yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in learning more about asteroseismology, we recommend the following review papers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Chaplin & Miglio (2013)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.1957.pdf) provides a review on asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators with *Kepler*, including an explanation of the seismic scaling relations.\n",
    "- [Aerts (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12300.pdf) provides a comprehensive review that covers asteroseismology of a wide range of oscillating stars, including solar-like oscillators.\n",
